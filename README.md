# esperGrid
A makeshift open-source module made for Python, about making grids made of ASCII

The data is stored in a 2D list, with each list representing a column and then each item in that list representing a single cell.
The grid will automatically scale to the contents of the grid, unless a cell width is specified (which might not actually work now I'm thinking about it).
When entering co-ordinates, a format is followed consistently.

**You can find the code in `esperGrid.py`.**
The file organisation is really messy due to the way that Replit runs things.
